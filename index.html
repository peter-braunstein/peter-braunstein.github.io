						<h3>What I like</h3>
						<p>I am a fan of minimalistic designs and interfaces with high contrast. I appreciate websites that put just as much time into their typography as they do their color scheme. I have a soft spot for hover states and think microinteractions will be the next big thing. </p>

						<h3>Why it's important</h3>
						<p>Devices will change dramtically over the next few years, and along with it, the user's experience will change too. My goal is to develop skills that transcend devices, sceen sizes, and perhaps even sceens themselves. I want to learn true UX design, a process that forms around interaction with the content, not the device itself. </p>

															     <p>For a Case Competition held by the business school at the University of Connecticut my team and I were face with creating a platform that increased fluid communication between all levels of a business. We developed an extremely extensive business plan and along with it I created several user interfaces to show how these preactices would be carried out in our product. For this Interface I incoperated both a chat box to allow simultaneous communication, both with the skype video chat as well as text based. Our main feautres were descriptions of each speaker, their queue in line to speak, their job and what topic they would speka about. In additon I added two features that held close to one of our main goals of time effciency. The "on schedule" bar at the top and the small "time-alloted box" next to the current speaker both helped push out product beyond a generic type facetime call.</p>

Our idea was that a more soical office where people actually knew eachother personally would aid in productivity. For this reason I added sports, and information about family, type of coffee they drink and other interests to the bio section.</p>

As you can see from the character on the far left, I had origianly started out in illustrator and then decided I didnt like it and moved to paper and pencil. I think this alone was the biggest part of the project. I had often started my projects straight in photoshop or illustraor before thinking them through. While this may work on occasion, starting on paper is something I always start with now. </p>

								<p>This is a poster that I made for a writing event held at Colby College. It had to incorperate several themes, including revoltution. This was one of the more difficult jobs I've done because it required me as a designer to be exremely flexible. This was fun to make and will hang in at the College for the next several years.</p>

															     <p>This is an example of my photoshop work. It was originally a photo of myself and my three friends from high school. Later in college I became proficent enough in photoshop and made this for them as a joke. I like to incorperate humor into my work becasue I feel it adds a personal touch that at least most people can aprechiate.</p>

															      <p>This was an expirimental movie for a project this year. I was tasked with creating something that incorperated the random line "I hate the green flashing light". I chose to make a time based gif that played off both A Clockwork Orange and The Great Gatsby. I wanted to make a juxstopostion of the cruel pysicallity of hating a green flashing light and an emotional internal struggle of the green light from the book. Its two minutes long and it is a just a loop so don't wait for anyhting to happen.</p>

															      <p>This was a project that I made last year. Each person in the class was assigned a differnet platform to create the video on. I was given "vine", hence the poor quality. Despite the pixelation I think this video more than any other shows who I am as a person/designer. I wanted to make it fun and rediculous but still tell a good story. I think that in UI/UX it is extemely important to be able to bring the user through a website and having good storytelling skills is incredibly helpful for that. </p>

															      <p>This is just a fun video I made for my friend who has a problem picking out his hairs. It is an actual disease and I wanted to poke fun at him in a way that wasn't mean. I love that digital media is a platform to share any idea with anyone, friends, family or someone half way across the globe who I've never met before.</p>

							<p>My name is Peter. I am a Junior at the University of Connecticut majoring in Digital Media and Design. I have a concentration in Web Design and Interactive Media and my goal is to become a UX designer. I am currently learning javascript and how to become proficient on a wacom tablet and in the next few months I am hoping to add Framer.JS to my skillset. I like those little green circles with the check mark in them that pop up when you enter correct information on forms and hate the sound that the machine makes when I take my chip out of the credit card reader. I apprechaite good movie references, hiking and swimming. I am a weekly listener of Jason Ogle's podcast "User Defenders" and would highly reccomend it to anyone interested in this discipline. I am lucky to enter a field where my creativity is awarded and hope to continue to solve problems with my work and, of course, make people laugh. </p>
